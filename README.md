# timed-coding-quiz
## Description 
Hello, 
Here you will find my first attempt to utilize JavaScript to make a quiz. I will be using:
-HTML
-CSS 
-JAVASCRIPT 
in order to develop a short coding quiz.
Challenges: I am still trying to understand JavaScript and therefore struggled to create the best functional quiz. However, I do plan to continue to study in order to be able to fully understand how to utilize JavaScript. I plan to come back update my work!
